# Overview

I do take notes on paper in college classes, but I find that programming with what I learned is one of the best ways to understand and remember the things I learned. In other words, if I want to remember something, I make a program out of it.

Why, then, are you doing it with Bash and not with a programming language like Python? I will certainly use Python, too -- [python-visualize-my-math-classes](https://github.com/soobinrho/python-visualize-my-math-classes).
I just wanted to get familiar with Bash as well, since Fedora ships with Bash.

You can find every code in this repository at the file `VisualizeMyMath`.
