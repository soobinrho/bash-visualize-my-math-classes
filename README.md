# Overview

Taking notes is essential for learning about something. Making a program out of it is my way of taking notes. Yes, of course, I do take notes on paper in college classes, but I find that making a program with what I learned is one of the best ways to understand and remember the mathematical concepts I learned.

Why, then, are you doing it with Bash and not with a programming language like Python? I will certainly use Python, too, but I just wanted to get familiar with Bash as well, since Fedora ships with Bash.
