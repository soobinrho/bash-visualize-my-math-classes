# shell scripts can have the file extension of `.sh` but it can 
# be more useful to leave it without any extension. instead, 
# just put the shebang `#!/bin/bash` at the first one.  
# plus, use `chmod +x` to make this script executable.
#
# also, apparently, this convention called shebang is not used
# on windows. `.sh` convention is used in windows. since i'm using
# fedora, i'm going to stick to the shebang convention.

# and then paste it onto another console by
# ```
# v
# "+y
# ctrl+shift+v
# ```
# this functionality is not available on normal vim though.
# on fedora, you can use this functionality by installing
# `vimx` and - of course - by using vimx to edit the files.
