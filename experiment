# Shell scripts can have the file extension of `.sh` but it can 
# be more useful to leave it without any extension. Instead, 
# just put the shebang `#!/bin/bash` at the first one.  
# Plus, use `chmod +x` to make this script executable.
#
# Also, apparently, this convention called shebang is not used
# on Windows. `.sh` convention is used in Windows. Since I'm using
# Fedora, I'm going to stick to the shebang convention.
